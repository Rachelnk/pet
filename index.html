      <h1>About pet</h1>
      <p>Zavi is a year and a month old male cat. <br> He's a European shorthair cat and grey and white in color. <br> Like most house cats he enjoys a 12-16 hour sleep time. </p>
      <p>For physical stimulation, AKA playtime he runs around the house, playing with yarn and toys, hiding behind crutains.
      <br> His diet consists of omena, mandazi, chapati supringsly enough. He can't consume cow's milk unfortunately.
       </p>  
       <p>He dislikes visits to the <em> vet </em>, being indoors for too long, as well as baths.</p>
       <p> He's a fast learner, he learned how to open window latches just through observation. He can also open lower cabinets</p>
       <p> He has scratched almost all the sofas and curtains, gone number 2 all over the house <br>
         but he was abandoned as a kitten and we gave him a home, love and sofas to destroy.</p>
         <p>Owning a pet can sometimes be overwhelming but they need patience, caring, understanding (since they're different from us) and love. <br>
        <em> Remember to take your furry friend to the vet regularly. </em>  </p>
